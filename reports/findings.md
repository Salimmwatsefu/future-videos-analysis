# Topic Modeling Findings for `future_videos.pdf`

This report summarizes the topic modeling analysis of `future_videos.pdf`, a document containing suggestions for improving business data analytics videos. Two methods were applied: **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** and **Correlation Explanation (CorEx)**, both identifying three key themes to guide video content development. The analysis processed 76 sections, yielding a dictionary of 432 unique terms, with results evaluated using coherence (LDA) and total correlation (CorEx).

## LDA Results
LDA, an unsupervised probabilistic model, was optimized for coherence, achieving a score of 0.4323 with 3 topics.

## CorEx Results
CorEx, a semi-supervised method, used anchor words derived from LDA and document themes, achieving a TC of 40.0580 with 3 topics.

### CorEx Topics Table
| Topic | Theme                     | Top Words                                                                 |
|-------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Practical Applications    | realworld, demonstration, study, tool, application, practical, example, customer, handson, apply |
| 2     | Emerging Technologies     | trend, automation, machine, predictive, learning, field, cloud, company, aipowere, report |
| 3     | Ethics & Skills           | practice, insight, skill, visualization, privacy, ethical, industry, responsible, technology, forecast |

- **Total Correlation**: 40.058022179838886
- **Anchor Strength**: 5
- **Anchors**:
  - Topic 1: `case, study, realworld, tool, practical, example, application, demonstration, customer`
  - Topic 2: `trend, predictive, machine, learning, cloud, quantum, automation, deep`
  - Topic 3: `ethical, privacy, visualization, skill, insight, bias, industry, practice`

## Comparison of LDA and CorEx
Both models identified three overlapping themes, but their approaches differ:
- **LDA (Unsupervised)**
  - Probabilistic, coherence-driven (0.4323).
  - Topics blend naturally occurring patterns (e.g., "predictive" in Topic 3 with practical terms).
  - More overlap (e.g., "study" across all topics).
- **CorEx (Semi-Supervised)**
  - Anchor-guided, TC-driven (40.0580).
  - Sharper separation due to anchors (e.g., "predictive" in Topic 2, tech-focused).
  - Includes anchored terms like "cloud," "visualization" explicitly.

### Key Differences
- **Practical Theme**: CorEx Topic 1 emphasizes demos ("demonstration," "handson") vs. LDA Topic 3’s broader tools ("power," "include").
- **Tech Theme**: CorEx Topic 2 isolates tech ("cloud," "machine") vs. LDA Topic 3 mixing "predictive" with practical terms.
- **Ethics/Skills**: CorEx Topic 3 separates ethics ("ethical," "privacy") and skills ("visualization," "skill") clearly, while LDA Topic 2 blends them with trends.

### Alignment with Document
Both models align with `future_videos.pdf`’s core suggestions:
- Practical case studies and tools (e.g., "Real-World Case Studies," "Hands-On Tutorials").
- Emerging technologies (e.g., "Predictive Analytics," "Machine Learning Basics").
- Ethical and skill-based content (e.g., "Data Ethics and Privacy," "Data Visualization").

## Identified Themes
Based on the combined findings, three primary themes emerge:
1. **Practical Applications & Tools**
   - Focus: Real-world examples, hands-on tutorials, tool demonstrations (e.g., Python, Power BI).
   - Evidence: CorEx Topic 1, LDA Topic 3.
   
2. **Emerging Technologies & Trends**
   - Focus: Predictive analytics, machine learning, cloud computing.
   - Evidence: CorEx Topic 2, LDA Topic 3 (partial), Topic 2 (trends).
   
3. **Ethics & Analytical Skills**
   - Focus: Data ethics, privacy, visualization, soft skills.
   - Evidence: CorEx Topic 3, LDA Topic 2, Topic 1 (skills).

## Conclusion
The topic modeling successfully distilled `future_videos.pdf` into three actionable themes for enhancing business data analytics videos. LDA’s high coherence (0.4323) and CorEx’s robust TC (40.0580) confirm these themes reflect the document’s intent. These findings suggest videos should prioritize practical, hands-on content, emerging tech insights, and ethical/skill-building lessons to meet learner needs effectively.
